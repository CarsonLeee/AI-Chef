# ðŸ“„ Project Description
This project, "AI-Chef", is a user-friendly web application that integrates OpenAI's GPT-3 and Spoonacular API to create an innovative culinary experience. The application allows users to input a set of ingredients, which then prompts GPT-3 and Spoonacular API to collaboratively generate unique, original recipes. The UI/UX is designed for optimal accessibility and usability, featuring a clean layout and responsive design. Functionality includes a "Generate Recipe" button that triggers the GPT-3 model and Spoonacular API, and real-time recipe generation displayed on the application's interface. This fusion of machine learning, API integration, and gastronomical exploration makes RecipeGen a dynamic tool for chefs and home cooks alike.
